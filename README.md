# odin-recipes
My first odin project

This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

The completed project must include various HTML elements, learned so far. It doesn't have to look
aesthetically pleasing but it should have proper structure and the potential to allow for it to 
be built up on. comments would be very helpful tools for the further progress of the project.
